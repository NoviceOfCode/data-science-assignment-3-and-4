**1)** Used the YGO Prodeck API and created a CSV file from the JSON returned:
https://db.ygoprodeck.com/api/v7/cardinfo.php . I  did not use a real-time connection because it is disallowed by API and the problem did not specify it had to be real-time. Run main.py in **Assignment_03/src**
**2)** Graph results are in **Assignment_04/results**. A graph is saved for each part of question 2.
